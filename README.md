# Audio-ResiDual
A project about exploring the effectiveness of applying the ResiDual spectral alignment method to the audio domain, working with the CLAP model. Developed for the Deep Learning course at Sapienza a.y. 2024/2025

The code is organized as follows:

1. the main experiments are contained in the 3 sequential notebooks
    - [1_Analyze_CLAP_Attention.ipynb](https://github.com/arianna011/Audio-ResiDual/blob/main/1_Analyze_CLAP_Attention.ipynb) includes an illustration of CLAP architecture and the formalization needed to properly extract attention head representantions, which are then  analyzed with PCA in order to study the intrinsic dimensionality and specialization of the corresponding spanned latent manifolds;
    -
